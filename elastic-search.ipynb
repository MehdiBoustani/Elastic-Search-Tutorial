    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s digital world, users interact with vast amounts of data through search interfaces—whether it's browsing e-commerce platforms, reading documentation, or exploring media archives. They expect search engines to return accurate, relevant results instantly, even when queries include misspellings, vague phrasing, or synonyms. These expectations have grown alongside the exponential increase in the volume, variety, and velocity of data generated across platforms and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This surge in data (structured, semi-structured, and unstructured) presents a major challenge. Traditional **relational databases**, while excellent for transactional operations and structured data storage, are ill-suited for flexible, large-scale search. Their rigid schemas, exact-match query requirements, and vertical scaling limitations make them inadequate for handling modern search demands, especially when working with diverse data types like JSON, logs, and text-heavy content.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **ElasticSearch** comes in. ElasticSearch is a powerful, open-source, distributed search and analytics engine designed to operate at scale with low latency. It is built on top of [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/), and provides robust full-text search capabilities, fault-tolerant horizontal scalability, and a flexible document-based data model. Its ability to handle fuzzy matching, relevance scoring, autocomplete, and real-time analytics makes it a core component of many data-driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional SQL-based systems, ElasticSearch uses a **schema-free JSON format** for indexing and querying, allowing for more dynamic data ingestion and flexible exploration. Features like *match*, *fuzzy match*, and *filtering* mechanisms allow users to retrieve relevant information, even in the presence of errors or ambiguous input, while keeping response times fast and consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce the core concepts of ElasticSearch, walk through its installation and setup, and demonstrate how to import and query data using real-world examples. Along the way, we will highlight key features such as full-text search, filtering, boosting, and aggregations, and also explore its limitations."

    "# How ElasticSearch works\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data format\n",
    "ElasticSearch manipulates data in the form of indexes, documents, and fields. These are the equivalent of databases, rows, and columns in traditional SQL-based databases management systems. The data is stored as JSON files, which allows ElasticSearch to have a flexible schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the data stored in a document, ElasticSearch uses [metadata fields](https://www.elastic.co/docs/reference/elasticsearch/mapping-reference/document-metadata-fields) to assist with querying. These fields are prefixed with an underscore (`_`) to distinguish them from regular data fields. Examples include `_id`, which represents the document’s unique identifier, and `_index`, which indicates the index the document belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an [example of a document](https://www.elastic.co/docs/manage-data/data-store/index-basics):\n",
    "\n",
    "```json{\n",
    "  \"_index\": \"my-first-elasticsearch-index\",\n",

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Distributed systems\n",
    "Since ElasticSearch is built to work on distributed systems at its core, it utilizes **clusters** (groups of machines), **nodes** (machines), and **shards** (pieces of indexes).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding is done by splitting each index into multiple parts called shards, which are distributed across different nodes in the cluster. Each shard is a fully functional Lucene index that can be searched and queried independently. When a document is indexed, ElasticSearch uses a hashing algorithm on the document’s ID to determine which primary shard it should be stored in. Replica shards are also created for fault tolerance and load balancing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of shards: **primaries** and **replicas**. Each document in an index belongs to one primary shard. A replica shard is a copy of a primary shard. Replicas maintain redundant copies of data across the nodes in a cluster. This protects against hardware failure and increases capacity to serve read requests like searching or retrieving a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Entire documents are sharded according to their document ID. The ID is hashed and then the hash modulo number of shards determines which primary shard receives the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows ElasticSearch to scale **horizontally**, meaning that adding more nodes to the cluster can distribute data and workload more effectively, leading to better performance, fault tolerance, and high availability."

    "## Representational Sate Transfer (REST)\n",
    "\n",
    "ElasticSearch follows the **REST** convention, which means that:\n",
    "- It is **stateless**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.\n",
    "- It follows a **client-server model**: The client (such as [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/fr/kibana) or an HTTP client) sends requests to the server (ElasticSearch), which processes and returns responses.\n",
    "- It has a **uniform interface**: Standard HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` are used to perform actions on resources (e.g., documents or indexes).\n",
    "- It is **resource-based**: Data is organized and accessed via URLs that represent resources (e.g., `/my_index/_doc/1` represents document ID 1 in the index `my_index`)."

    "ElasticSearch uses its own **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** for querying and manipulating data. This JSON-based query language allows users to build rich and expressive queries to filter, sort, aggregate, and search data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DSL is structured in a way that enables:\n",
    "- Full-text search\n",
    "- Structured filtering\n",
    "- Complex aggregations (like averages, histograms, and term counts)\n",
    "- Boolean logic (`must`, `should`, `must_not`)\n",

    "## Inverted indexes\n",
    "An **inverted index** is a core data structure used by ElasticSearch to enable fast and efficient full-text searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "An inverted index can be compared to the index at the back of a book:\n",
    "- A regular (forward) index maps documents to the words (terms) they contain.\n",
    "- An inverted index maps each word (term) to the list of documents that contain it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, in the forward index (left), each document ID points to the term it contains — this is useful for storing what’s in each document. In contrast, the inverted index (right) flips this around: each term points to the document IDs where it appears. This reversal enables fast full-text searches, since you can quickly find all documents containing a specific word like \"Cat\" (which appears in documents 1, 3, and 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An inverted index is composed of:\n",
    "1. A **term dictionary** that maps terms to postings lists, implemented as a [finite state transducer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_transducer)[<sup>1</sup>](#invertedindex);\n",
    "2. **Postings lists** which are lists of document IDs in which the terms appear. There is additional metadata associated with the document IDs, such as:\n",
    "    - *Term frequency*: How often the term appears in each document.\n",
    "    - *Positions*: The positions within the document where the term appears (for phrase queries).\n",
    "    - *Offsets*: Byte offsets in the text.  \n",

Tomorrow, a full moon will occur that appears slightly larger and brighter than usual. The reason is that the Moon's fully illuminated phase occurs within a short time from perigee - when the Moon is its closest to the Earth in its elliptical orbit. Although the precise conditions that define a supermoon vary, tomorrow's supermoon will undoubtedly qualify because it will be the closest, largest, and brightest full moon in over 65 years. One reason supermoons are popular is because they are so easy to see -- just go outside at sunset and watch an impressive full moon rise! Since perigee actually occurs tomorrow morning, tonight's full moon, visible starting at sunset, should also be impressive. Pictured here, a supermoon from 2012 is compared to a micromoon -- when a full Moon occurs near the furthest part of the Moon's orbit -- so that it appears smaller and dimmer than usual. Given many definitions, at least one supermoon occurs each year, with another one coming next month (moon-th). However, a full moon will not come this close to Earth again until 2034.\", 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1611/supermicromoon_paduraru_960.jpg', 'authors': 'Catalin Paduraru\\n'}\n",

But only since the 1990s have observers began to regularly record and study optical flashes on the lunar surface, likely explosions resulting from impacting meteoroids. Of course, the flashes are difficult to see against a bright, sunlit lunar surface. But during the January 21 total eclipse many imagers serendipitously captured a meteoroid impact flash against the dim red Moon. Found while examining images taken shortly before the total eclipse phase began, the flash is indicated in the inset above, near the Moon's darkened western limb. Estimates based on the flash duration recorded by the Moon Impact Detection and Analysis System (MIDAS) telescopes in southern Spain indicate the impactor's mass was about 10 kilograms and created a crater between seven and ten meters in diameter.\", 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1901/2019_01_21_ZM_Single_crop1024.jpg', 'authors': 'Petr Horálek\\n'}\n",

Gemini will be pretty easy for skygazers to find too as it won't be far from a nearly full waning gibbous Moon. You don't have look at the shower's radiant to see meteors though. The almost full moonlight won't hide the brightest of the Geminids from view either, but it will substantially reduce the rate of visible meteors for those who are counting. In fact, the 2019 Geminids should look a lot like the 2016 meteor shower.

Of course the Moon will look almost full in the surrounding days. Regardless of your time zone the Harvest Moon, like any other full moon, will rise just opposite the setting Sun. Near the horizon, the Moon Illusion might make it appear bigger and brighter to you but this Harvest Moon will be near lunar apogee. That's the farthest point in its orbit, making it the most distant, and so the smallest, full moon of the year.

The exposures were taken from South Africa just before occultation -- and also just before sunrise. When Saturn re-appeared on the other side of the Moon almost two hours later, the Sun had risen.

Unfortunately, in this case, there seemed no other way than getting bogged down in mud and resting the camera on a barbed-wire fence. The arc in the oak tree was previously created by hungry cows in Knight's Ferry, California, USA. Quirky Moon-tree juxtapositions like this can be created during any full moon though, given enough planning and time. Another opportunity will arise this weekend, coincidently during another blue moon. Then, the second blue moon in 2018 will occur, meaning that for the second month this year, two full moons will appear during a single month (moon-th). Double blue-moon years are relatively rare, with the last occurring in 1999, and the next in 2037.\", 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1803/MoonTree_Houck_960.jpg', 'authors': 'Eric Houck\\n'}\n",

A relatively rare phenomenon in clouds known as iridescence can bring up unusual colors vividly or even a whole spectrum of colors simultaneously. These polar stratospheric clouds clouds, also known as nacreous and mother-of-pearl clouds, are formed of small water droplets of nearly uniform size. When the Sun is in the right position and, typically, hidden from direct view, these thin clouds can be seen significantly diffracting sunlight in a nearly coherent manner, with different colors being deflected by different amounts. Therefore, different colors will come to the observer from slightly different directions. Many clouds start with uniform regions that could show iridescence but quickly become too thick, too mixed, or too angularly far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors.

Evidence bolstering very recent volcanism on Venus has recently been uncovered, though, right here on Earth.

Venus Express entered orbit around Venus in 2006 and remained in contact with Earth until 2014. Therefore, the infrared glow (shown in false-color red) recorded by Venus Express for Idunn Mons and featured here on a NASA Magellan image indicates that this volcano erupted very recently -- and is still active today.

A ring-of-fire eclipse is an annular eclipse that occurs when the Moon is far enough away on its elliptical orbit around the Earth so that it appears too small, angularly, to cover the entire Sun. At the maximum of an annular eclipse, the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun. This particular eclipse, they knew, would peak soon after sunrise. After seeking out such a dry and barren place, it turned out that some of the most interesting eclipse images actually included a tree in the foreground, because, in addition to the sand dunes, the tree gave the surreal background a contrasting sense of normalcy, scale, and texture.', 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/DesertEclipse_Daviron_960.jpg', 'authors': 'Maxime Daviron\\n'}\n",

The distance from the Sun doesn't determine the seasons, though. Those are governed by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation, so January is still winter in the north and summer in southern hemisphere. But it does mean that on January 5 the Sun was at its largest apparent size. This composite neatly compares two pictures of the Sun, both taken from planet Earth with the same telescope and camera. The left half was captured on the date of the 2020 perihelion. The right was recorded only a week before the July 4 date of the 2019 aphelion, the farthest point in Earth's orbit. Otherwise difficult to notice, the change in the Sun's apparent diameter between perihelion and aphelion amounts to a little over 3 percent. The 2020 perihelion and the preceding 2019 aphelion correspond to the closest and farthest perihelion and aphelion of the 21st century.\", 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/peri-api-sun1024.jpg', 'authors': 'Ian Griffin\\n'}\n",

The orange and purple colors of the nebula are present in different regions and are created by different processes. The bright star AE Aurigae, visible toward the image left, is so hot it is blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas. When a proton recaptures an electron, red light is frequently emitted (depicted here in orange). The purple region's color is a mix of this red light and blue light emitted by AE Aurigae but reflected to us by surrounding dust. The two regions are referred to as emission nebula and reflection nebula, respectively. Pictured here in the Hubble color palette, the Flaming Star Nebula, officially known as IC 405, lies about 1500 light years distant, spans about 5 light years, and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga).\", 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/IC405hp_ColesHelm_960.jpg', 'authors': 'Eric Coles, Mel Helm\\n'}\n",

In this night skyscape the Hunter's stars rise in the northern hemisphere's winter sky on December 30, 2019, tangled in bare trees near Newnan, Georgia, USA. Red supergiant star Betelgeuse stands out in yellowish hues at Orion's shoulder left of center, but it no longer so strongly rivals the blue supergiant star Rigel at the Hunter's foot. In fact, skygazers around planet Earth can see a strikingly fainter Betelgeuse now, its brightness fading by more than half in the final months of 2019. Betelgeuse has long been known to be a variable star, changing its brightness in multiple cycles with approximate short and long term periods of hundreds of days to many years. The star is now close to its faintest since photometric measurements in 1926/27, likely due in part to a near coincidence in the minimum of short and long term cycles. Betelgeuse is also recognized as a nearby red supergiant star that will end its life in a core collapse supernova explosion sometime in the next 100,000 years, though that cosmic cataclysm will take place a safe 700 light-years or so from our fair planet.\", 'image_url': 'https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/2001/OrionTrees123019Westlake1024.jpg', 'authors': 'Jimmy Westlake\\n'}\n"

Dubbed a molten Einstein ring for its unusual shape, four images of the same background galaxy have been identified. Typically, a foreground galaxy cluster can only create such smooth arcs if most of its mass is smoothly distributed -- and therefore not concentrated in the cluster galaxies visible.

Also the wind high in Earth's atmosphere blew the meteor's glowing evaporative molecule train away from the galaxy, in angular projection. Still, the astrophotographer was quite lucky to capture both a meteor and a galaxy in a single exposure -- which was subsequently added to two other images of M33 to bring up the spiral galaxy's colors.

In fact, the cavernous NGC 604 is the brightest star forming region, seen here at about the 1 o'clock position from the galaxy center.

The green color was created, at least in part, by the meteor's gas glowing as it vaporized.

    "# Limitations of ElasticSearch[<sup>15</sup>](#ESvsSQL1) [<sup>16</sup>](#ESvsSQL2) [<sup>17</sup>](#ESvsSQL3)\n",
    "One of the most commonly mentioned limitations in forums and blogs is that ElasticSearch performance and data durability can be heavily constrained by the resources allocated to the cluster. To maintain good performance and ensure data survivability, it may be necessary to increase the number of nodes and replicate data across them. This is not a technical limitation per se, but rather an infrastructure constraint that depends on available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a technical standpoint, ElasticSearch is built on top of the **Lucene engine**, which is optimized for full-text search rather than relational queries such as joins or transactions. While ElasticSearch does offer limited support for join-like operations[<sup>11</sup>](#JoinQueries), they are far less powerful than those available in SQL databases and are typically very resource-intensive[<sup>12</sup>](#ressourcesLimit). As a result, these features are often disabled in production configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of consistency, ElasticSearch follows an eventual consistency model rather than strong consistency. This means that in certain race conditions, inconsistencies in query results can occur shortly after data is written or updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a portion of ElasticSearch is available for free, accessing the full feature set—particularly advanced security, monitoring, and machine learning capabilities—requires a paid license.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, ElasticSearch remains one of the most powerful and widely adopted solutions for full-text search, offering high performance, scalability, and a rich query language. Its ability to index and search large volumes of textual data in near real-time makes it a strong choice for use cases such as log analytics, product search, and document indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatives to ElasticSearch include **Apache Solr**, which is also built on Lucene and excels in traditional search applications, and **OpenSearch**, a community-driven fork of ElasticSearch that retains many of its features under a fully open-source license.  [<sup>13</sup>](#ESalternative1) [<sup>14</sup>](#ESalternative2)\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL for full-text search\n",
    "While many relational databases offer built-in full-text extensions, they remain fundamentally optimized for structured, transactional workloads rather than rich, large-scale text retrieval. Below are four core reasons why SQL full-text search falls short compared to ElasticSearch:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Limited Indexing Control & Analysis\n",
    "- **Bolt-on inverted index**  \n",
    "  SQL full-text search layers an inverted index onto its B-tree/row-store engine, but provides virtually no knobs for customizing tokenization, stemming, or character filters.  \n",
    "- **Minimal analyzer pipelines**  \n",
    "  Text is split on whitespace/punctuation with fixed stemmers and stop-words—no pluggable analyzers, synonym maps, or language-specific processing as in ElasticSearch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Restricted Query & Search Features  \n",
    "- **Limited query operators**  \n",
    "  SQL full-text supports only Boolean operators (e.g., `CONTAINS`, `FREETEXT`) and basic proximity/NEAR clauses; there’s no built-in fuzzy, wildcard, regex, or span query support.  \n",
    "- **DIY fuzzy workarounds**  \n",
    "  To approximate typo-tolerance you must implement custom edit-distance functions or join strategies, which are far more complex and slower than Elasticsearch’s native fuzzy queries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Scalability & Distributed Architecture  \n",
    "- **Monolithic extension**  \n",
    "  Full-text runs in-process on your primary database server, limiting throughput under heavy search loads.  \n",
    "- **No native sharding/replication**  \n",
    "  ElasticSearch auto-shards, replicates, and rebalances indices across nodes; SQL Server or MySQL require manual partitioning or expensive clustering extensions to scale horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison between relational Databases and ElasticSearch [<sup>18</sup>](#TableGen)\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We began this tutorial by introducing the goals of ElasticSearch and how it leverages complex indexing mechanisms to deliver high performance and scalability. We also provided a brief recap of what indexes are, how they are used in relational databases, and the limitations and performance costs they can introduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we progressed, we walked through setting up an ElasticSearch cluster using Docker, connecting to it, and uploading bulk data. We then explored the basic API operations for document manipulation by ID and highlighted the differences between Query DSL and SQL. From there, we reviewed a broad range of advanced query types and features specifically tailored for building powerful search engine experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ElasticSearch proved to be quite intuitive. Even though we only covered a subset of its capabilities, it quickly became clear how the technology fits into real-world applications. Along the way, we encountered many configuration parameters that allow you to fine-tune ElasticSearch's behavior to meet specific needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ElasticSearch excels at full-text search, it may require more resources than a traditional database system. We also noted that its eventual consistency model differs from conventional databases, making it less suitable for some workflows. Nevertheless, if your application requires a robust and flexible full-text search engine, ElasticSearch is one of the most powerful solutions available, thanks to its rich feature set and high configurability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you should now have the knowledge and skills to build your first search engine application. With a thoughtfully designed search interface and parameterized queries, you can now deliver accurate and relevant results to your users efficiently and effectively."
